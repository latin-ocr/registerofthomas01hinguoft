PREFACE.

an: ansmz· of Bishop Thomas de Brantyngham is oomprised
in two folio Volumes, written on vellum. A few of the leaves, in
both Volumes, have been injured by (lamp 3 but, happssy, it has
been found possible to read, or supply with certainty, every

damaged word.¹ In other respeots both Volumes are in an excellent
state of preservation throughout.

Volume I contains-² the continuation from Volume II of the
“Registrum (3001011111οΓ which, except for the theft of a single
folio, is complete from the 5th of March, 1369-70, the date of
the Bull of Pope Urban the Fifth‚ to the 16th of May, 1392, rather
more than two years and a half before the Bishop's death. The last

Entry, a long one, beginning on folio 231 and oecupying the whole
of folio 231b, has been mutilated, through the loss of the succeeding

folios, and its date has eonsequently perished. This Volume oon-
sists now, therefore, of 231 folios, nominally, but, really, of 230,
folio 69 having been cut out.. The writing of the earlier folios

(1—48)‚ though quite legible, is extremely poor and irregular, the
work of several unskilful hands3 the remainder of the Volume is,
with few exceptione, beautifully written.

¹ The headings of the Entries are, with very few exceptions, written 011 1110
margins, and only portions of such headings have been damaged hy (lamp.
Words which have pei-ished, or of which only very slight traces remain, have
been easily restored after comparisou with the text of the Entries. The
numbers of the folios were entered at the top of each page, at the extreme
right-hand corner, and of these a great many have been quite destroyed, render-
ing reference 10 1110 0011101118 of the 110013101- difficult. Attempts have been made
to meet this difficulty. after 11 1110111011, hy 111 least two careless scribes, who. 111
many places have entered the missing figures, in inlr, quite inaccurately, here
and there corrovting one anothcr's work, 11111 often not correctly3 thus causing·
great confusion. Ι have entered the true figures throughout, in pencz'l,
wherever neeessary3 and I need scarcely say that all 1110 references in my
Books are 1ο my own peneilled figures. It would be well, Ι think, that the

folios should be properly renumbered 111 ink, and the misle-adina figures can-
celled, by competent authority.

really, Vol. I. See page 3 for 1110 Genera] Title.
