wode, Sequestrator-General in Devon.—The Bishop had recently visited
Tavistock Abbey, and had arranged to deal with certain matters which
demanded reformation ou the Wednesday next after the Feast of St.
Barnabas, but he was obliged to postpone the Visitation of the Abbey till
the Wednesday next after the Feast of St. James, and they were to
prorogue the Visitation accordingly.—Dated at East Horsley, 29 May.

63.—'I'o Masters John Wyliot, Chaneellor of the Cathedral, and Hugh Hic-
lynge, Precentor of Crediton.—Master william Bamptone, Canon of
Crediton‚ had appeared before the Bishop, and assured him that Canon
Henry Pyke had not died intestate, but had made his Will, “ ut debuit ”3
it was duly scaled and witnessed 3 there were many leg-acies, and he, the
said william, was named therein as one of the Executors. He was him-
self present when the Will was made, and had promised to serve. After
testator-'s death, feeling some doubt as to the validity of the Will, he had
concluded that the administration of the effects of the deceased, as of a
man dying intestate, had lapsed to the Bishop. But he had recently
ascertained that he had been mistaken in this, as the witnesses, who still
survived, could prove 3 and he was afraid that, through his carelessness,
the testator would be wronged and the legatees prejudiced. Accordingly,
he besought the Bishop to intervene and sanction his fulfilling his duties
as an Executor. The Bishop, being absent from the Diocese, appointed
the above—named Commissaries to deal with the matter on his bebalf,
requiring them to commit the execution of the Will, “prout decet‚’'
to the said William and Sir Roger de Chestrefelde, R. of Ipplepen, re-
voking all previous Commissions (see No. 58).—Dated at Faringdon
(Ham), 30 June.

—The Precentorship being the subject of litigation, the tenants thereos
had complained to the Bishop that they had been aggrieved by the ex-
actione of the Parties to the suit, and feared further exactions in the
future unless the Bishop could protect them. He issued this Commission,
accordingly, without prejudice to the rights of the litigantS,-“ne pro-

ο cedatur ad graviores lites et arma’'; sequestrating the revenues “lite

pendente,” and directing the Commissaries to collect the rents, etc-,—
