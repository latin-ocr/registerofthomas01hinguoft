ad alia loca transferri non debeant, juxta Canonicas et legitimas Saucciones;

ex clamosa, tamen, insinuacione ad nostrum noviter pervenit auditum quod'

quidam iniquitatis filii, quorum nomina ignorantur pariter et persone,

corpus cujusdam Domini Stephani Drewe, presbiteri, et dum vixit Vicarii
Ecclesie nostre Exoniensis predicte, in claustro ejusdem Eeclesie perpetue
traditum Ecclesiastico sepulture, absque causa racionabili seu legitima
quacumque ac auctoritate et consilio nostris Pmtificalibus, inhumaniter
exhumare et ad alium locum transferre, pro ipsorum libito voluntatis,

, temere presumpserunt, contra Sacrorum Oanonum et Legum precepta,

ac in nostre auctoritatis Pontificalis contemptum eciam manifestum, maxi-
mumque scandalum plurimorum. Nolentes, igitur, hujusmodi delicta,

Marus.
