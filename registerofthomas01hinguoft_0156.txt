Bishop Brantyngham died on the 23rd of December, 1394, about three weeks
after the latest of these Entries. It is deeply to be regretted that his fine Register
of Institutione should have been marred by the shameful abstracting of several
folios3 a loss which is, of course, irrepat-able. It will be found, too, that, in
several places, room was reserved for Entries which were never made. But, on
the whole, the record is fairly continuone and complete. 1 sa “continuous,” because
in nearly every instance the name of the predecessor, w o had either resigned
his Benefice or had died, is given, which was far from being the cese in the

earlier Registers. And it will be found that some of the omitted Entries cen be ,

supplied from the Register of Commissions, iu which Institutione by com-
missaries, after Inquisitions made on t-he spot, are duly recorded. There will,
therefore, be very little difficulty in compiling complete Lists of successive Incum-

bents, as far as their names are concerned, though in many cases the data of
Institution have perished with the stolen folios.
