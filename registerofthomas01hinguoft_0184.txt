mino tenen'tur reddere racionem ; se mercenarios, quibus non est cura de
ovibus, cum lucra animarum non querant, pocius quam pastores, osten·
dentes ; ab Ecclesiis ipsis, absque Licencia nostra seu aliqua causa racio-
nabin, sc absentant et absentarunt, ac absentavit eorum uterque per tem-
pora diuturna, Ecclesiarum hujusmodi et parochianorum suorum curam
et regimen temere deserendo; propter que in gregibus sibi commissis
vicia pululant, Divinus Cultus diminuitur, hospitalitas subtrahitur, et
edificia Beneficiorum suorum hujusmodi collabuntur, graviaque scandala
suscitantur, ac, prochdolor, anime parochianorum suorum, ad quorum
salutem ipsi spirituales medici deputantur, evidentibus periculis ex·
ponuntur.” The Commissaries were to admonish the offenders to return
to their Benefices and submit to correction and punishment, which for
this time would fall short of deprivation.—Dated London, 6 Nov.

¹0¹- 172-—T0 Master John de Uphulle, Canon of Bosham.—Sir Thomas Whyte-

41. webbe complained to the Bishop, as Ordinary, that, having been, some
time ago, appointed Perpetual Vicar of Rosam, and also one of the
Vicars-Choral‚ he had suffered much from the interference of Sir Roget
Prymer, the Sam-istan, and Sir John Seyntdeneys, one of the Vicars, who
had usurped, and continued to usurp, his parochial rights; baptizing
infante without asking his leave, and visiting his sick parishioners and
hearing their confessions. The Sacristan had deprived him of the habit
which both he and his predecessors had always worn in the Choir, and
had taken away his rightful share in certain oblations and distributione·
He begged the Bishop to provide a remedy ; aud Uphulle was commissioued
to make inquiry, and do justice to the complainant if these charges were
prowm-Data (sic).

173. -To the Archdeacon of Barnstaple.-—-The Bishop had been informed
that the Cemetery of the Church of BARNSTAPLE had been polluted by
bloodshed, during a fight between two of the parishioners, Ralph Symon
and Richard Warnes. The Archdeacon was to investigate the case ; and,
if he found that the said cemetery had been polluted as alleged, he was
to forbid all interments therein until it should have been reconciled.—
