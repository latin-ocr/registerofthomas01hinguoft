deacon of Cornwall was commissioned to hold the customary Inquisition
as to vacancy, ete„ and report to the Bishop.—Dated London, 13 Jan„

Bishop Stafford's Reqister, page 322) that Thomas Elwel exchanged St.
Pinnock for Cold Ashton (Diocese of Worcester) with Walter Lewer,
21 May, 1389. Bishop Stafford, in his Return to a Writ, dated 12 Now,
1414, informed the King that he had found the record of this Exchange
in Bishop Brantyngham’s Registen and that Henry, Bishop of worcester,
by Commission from the Bishop of Exeter, authorized the Exchange and
instituted Elwel to St. Pinnock. The folio containing this record has

been abstracted (see p. 107). ,

208.--To Masters Richard Colshulle‚ Canon of Glaeney, and Thomas Noelle,
Official-Peeuliar in Cornwall.--After his Visitation of the Collegiate
Church of GLASNEY‚ the Bisho'p had done his best to effect a reformation
of the grave excesses and offences of the Canens and other Ministers which
he had then discovered. But he had been informed that the offenders
were still living dissolute lives, even harbouring women of suspicions
character in their houses. The Commissaries were to make careful
inquiry as to these charges, and especially as to the alleged misconduct
with loose women.—Dated London, 26 J an.
