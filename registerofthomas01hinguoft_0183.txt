fol. 163—'1'0 Masters John Lugans and Walter de N ywatnue, Rectors of Pet-

38b. rockstowe and Morchard-Bishop.—-Sir Henry Hendre, V. of BURRme'rON,
having resigned his Benefice, the King had presented Oliver Ratiatum-thy,
priest ; but the Bishop had refused to admit him because it was notorious
that he had committed homicide, and the charge had been proved against
him by an Inquisition held by the Official of the Archdeacon of Barnstaple.
The Bishop did not know the reason for Hendre’s Resignation, or whether
the homicide had been committed iu self-defenoe or maliciously. The-y
were to ascertain whether the said Resignation was voluntary or tainted
with simony3 and whether Oliver‚ as appears to have been alleged, was
so mangled and hard pressed that he could not escape from his adversm-y,
aud was forced to kill him in order to save his own life.—Dated at Clyst,
4 Aug. [The King, subsequently, presented Sir Roqer Gale, priest, who
was inst„ 12 Jan„ 1385-6. See page 94.]
