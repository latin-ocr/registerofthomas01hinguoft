Voluine II consists, nominally, of 279 folios, but, really, of only
267, 110 fower than 12 folios having fallen victims to dep1·edat01·s;
viz„ seven (folios 29, 35, 1'04, 111, 116, 117, 118) from the Regis-tter
of Institutions) and five (folios 1, 2, 3, 8, 9), from the nine folios,
containing niisccllaneous Entries, which have been bound in ab the
beginning of ⁴⁶ The Register of Commissions,'’ and included with it
in its own separate numeration. This Volume contains—

(1.) The first part of the “ R-egistrum Commune,'' A.D. 1369-70 ;
folios 1—6.·2

(2.) The Register of Institutions, Collatvions, and Inductions,
. A.D. 1370—13943 folios 7—154.³

(3.) Miscellaneous Entries of various dates,- folios (under a
separate 'numeration) 1—9‚ of which only folios 4-7
remain. The first of these Documents (now, alas, a mere
fragment) was a heautifully wiitten copy of the Bishop's
Ordina-nce for the Dedication of the Chapel and Cemetery
of St. Saviour’s, Dartmouth, in 1372. Happily‚ this
Document, which is of great interest, has been preserved,
in full, in the Regis‘ter itself.⁴ The other EntrieS, also,
belong to the ‘⁴ Registrum Commune,’' and will be found
therein under their proper datos, with marginal refe-
rences 10 these sti-ay folios.⁵

(4.) The Register of Commissions, A.D. 1370-1387-85 folios
(numbered in continuation from those of 1110 above group)
10—55.⁴⁵

(5.) The Register of Royal letters and Writs, A.D. 1370-
1383 ; folios (under another separate numeration) 1-22,⁷

“Desunt hic quodum Folia?v and on tln¹ top ‹›'' folio lo ⁴· Desunt hic duo

several quaterni wore bound into a Volunw. In [110 'other cases the missing
leaves must hav<= been removed after the binding, the clean-cut stumps re-
maining to 1011 1110 11110. ⁰ ’
