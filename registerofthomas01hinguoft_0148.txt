datum fuit Magistris Ricardo Hals et J ohanni Chamberleyn, Commissariis
in Archidiacouatu Exoniensi, pro ipsius Induccione.”—The date (29 June)
shews that this Institution was subsequent‚ by a few days, to the Ex-
change and Institution which occurred 16 June, when “Sir Nicholas”
was inst. in the person of his Proctor, the said Sir John Hokere. William
Slade obtained Axmouth‚ and he was V. there till 2 Feb„ 1397-8, when he
became Warden of Ottery Collegiate Church ; and John Hokere was R. of
Cotleigh when he exchanged for the Rectory of St. Michael’s, Bristol,
14 Oct„ 1402 (Biskop Stafford’s Εερίείεν, pp. 143, 159). It will be ob-
served that Sir Nicholas simply disappears, though his Exchange was
authorized and Institution followed. See the Cotleigh and Axmouth
