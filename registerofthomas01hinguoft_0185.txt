1385-6. the Consistory Coum—Sir Thomas Bernarde, chaplain, had complaiued
JANU· that one Sir Baldwin Wylle, chaplain, had been intruded into the Vicarage
“³¹⁰⁵- 0f DAvmsa-own by the Patrona, the Maseer and Brethren of the Hospital
of St. J ohn-the-Baptist at Bridgwater (to whom the Church was appro-
prhated), and held the Benefice de facto, not de jure: the actual Vicar,
Sir Robert Knthte, being still alive. The said Bafflwin, it was alleged,
had mendaciously reported to the Patrons that the Vicar was dead 3 and,
on their Presentation, Lugans, as Vicar-General, had admitted Baldwin
and instituted him, not knowing that the Benefiee was full at the time
when the Presentation was made. Meanwhile the Vicar died, and the
Patrone, having discovered how flagrautly they had been deceived, re-
solved to expose the fraud, and presented to the Vicarage, then really
vacant, Thomas Bernarde, the complainant. Baldwin‚ however, was not
so easily disposed of ; he was in possession and claimed to be the rightful
Vicar. Accordingly Bernarde appealed to the Bishop for a remedy ; and
the above-named Commissaries were ordered to cite all persons concerned
to appear before them, and to institute complainant if it should be proved
that a fraud had been committed.—Dated London, 24 Jan„ 1385-6. [The
said Thomas Barnard (sic) died V. of Davidstow in March, 1407-8; see
